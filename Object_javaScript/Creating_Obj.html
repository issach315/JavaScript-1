        In JavaScript, an object is a standalone entity, with properties and type.
         Compare it with a cup, for example. A cup is an object, with properties.
          A cup has a color, a design, weight, a material it is made of, etc. The same way, 
          JavaScript objects can have properties, which define their characteristics.
